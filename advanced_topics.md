#####New USB Drive:  
Insert your USB Drive into your computer. You may have to use a disk utility to reformat the USB disk to FAT filesystem if it is not already in this format. 

Download the C&G Organelle patches from here: https://github.com/critterandguitari/Organelle_Patches/archive/master.zip  

Unzip the file and rename folder `Patches` (case sensitive).  

Copy `Patches` to the root directory of drive. For example, the 'Analog Style' patch would be located like this: `/YourUSBdrive/Patches/Analog Style`  

Eject drive from your computer
Insert drive in Organelle and select `Reload` from `Storage` menu.
  
#####New SD Card  
Download the microSD card disk image to your computer: http://thepeacetreaty.org/organelle/diskimages/20180529-v3.1.img.zip  

Download this program to your computer to burn the OS on to the SD card:  https://etcher.io/  

Power down the Organelle  

Locate the thin slit in the rear of the enclosure (above 'Critter'). Use a pin or paperclip to press in on the black SD card to eject it and it will spring out gently.  

Insert microSD into your computer (you may need an adapter)  

Use the Etcher program to burn the OS on to the SD Card. Be sure to unzip the disk image before burning. Although Etcher says it can burn from a zip, we have have trouble doing so.  

After Etcher is finished, remove the microSD card from your computer and reinsert it in Organelle. Make sure it does not fall in the enclosure. You may want to flip the Organelle upside down. You will have to use the same pin/paperclip to press it in until you hear/feel a 'click.'  

Restart the Organelle
